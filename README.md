nameparts is a code port from a Python project to NodeJS to Elixir. The original Python module was written by [James Polera](https://github.com/polera) to address the problem of having to split full names into individual parts (first, middle, last, etc.) and ported to NodeJS by [Gary Slawinski](https://github.com/Ghary).
